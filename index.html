          <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
          <p class="goal-text">
            Over the next two years, I have set several ambitious career goals
            focused on advancing my skills and securing a position in the tech
            industry, specifically in frontend development and software testing.
            My immediate goal is to reach Stage 10 of the HNG internship within
            the next two months. This will provide me with valuable experience
            and skills in frontend development. By the last quarter of this
            year, I aim to become a proficient frontend developer and software
            tester. This involves rigorous learning and hands-on practice to
            master the necessary technologies and tools. Before the end of this
            year, I plan to start preparing for software and frontend
            development interviews. This preparation will include practicing
            with interview questions and building a strong portfolio to showcase
            my skills. Starting from the first quarter of next year, I will
            begin applying for junior frontend and software testing positions.
            My goal is to secure interviews and demonstrate my capabilities to
            potential employers. By the second quarter of next year, I aim to
            secure a job in either frontend development or software testing.
            This milestone will mark a significant step in my career
            progression. Leveraging my skills in frontend development and
            software testing, I plan to enhance sales through my e-commerce
            platform. This involves optimizing the user experience and ensuring
            the site runs smoothly and efficiently. These goals are designed to
            push me towards becoming a skilled professional in the tech
            industry. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and
            I am confident that with dedication and hard work, I will achieve
            these objectives.
